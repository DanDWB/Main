        <h2>December 2019</h2>
        <p>It was around this time that I started to get the initial random ideas popping into my head. I just started to get thoughts pass by one after the other - spheres, UFO's, black holes, the end of our Sun. So I thought to myself that I should start writing all of these thoughts down and maybe even compiling some sort of a story. <br>
            I had seen a UFO when I was younger, and so did my dad during his younger days. That, I think coupled with being a massive science fiction geek anyway, growing up with all of the amazing 80's films that we had, was likely the inspiration that lit the fire. The ideas just seemed to surge forward easily, coming thick and fast once I decided to start writing.  
            I started to draft out the major plot points and officially draft one was under way.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-image sample-6"></div> 
        <h2>December 2020</h2>
        <p>One year later - December 2020, after having more time than expected to sit and write, thanks to Covid-19! I now had a completed draft one. Looking back - it was bloody awful. I had never written down a story before, and it showed. 
            I searched for beta readers that I could send it to, as well as using family and friends to read it for me. I received some blunt, but very constructive advice.  
            It was clear that my work was nowhere near finished. Before cracking on with it again, I started to watch Youtube videos about writing, and I now read books every single day, to try to improve my writing. I realised that I had so much to learn, there were so many things that I hadn’t even considered the first time around. Things like how there are certain ways to use people's viewpoints in writing, narrative structures, certain faux pa's when starting or ending chapters. That I needed detail, but not too much so as to bore the reader - "info dumping". 
            I know now that really I should have looked into creative writing courses. I felt bad for not doing so, but I was already so deep into it.
            It was back to the drawing board - or keyboard.  
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-image sample-5"></div> 
        <h2>January 2022</h2>
        <p>A little over a year later - fast forward to January 2022. I had now completely re-written the story. It was needed, it was hard work, but I was honest enough with myself to admit that it wasn't anywhere near the standard that it should be. 
            A lot of polishing, expanding, and generally better writing - hopefully, made it jump from 50k words to 100k words. I now felt like I had a book on my hands, although there was still a way to go.

    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-image sample-3"></div> 
        <h2>April 2022</h2>
        <p>I spent from January to April this year, polishing it, checking the times, and subplots, making sure it all made sense. It was then that I started to shop around on Fiverr - the marketplace of people offering their services - for an editor. Again, there are so many options, developmental editing, line editing, copy editing. I went for the option that I knew I could afford, the one which seemed like a good fit for me, and Cleo Miele of Miele Proofreading – the editor that I chose, from Texas USA - was also like me, a self-confessed “Science fiction nerd.” Happy days!
            I now started to shop around for a cover designer, at first I was saving people under my Fiverr profile, one or two stood out as good artists. Between the editor and cover designer, this is where the major investment comes in, this can cost a fortune. For your first book you have to be very selective, choosing services that offer a good mixture of being financially viable for you, and being a good fit – creatively for your project.

        <h2>July 2022</h2>
        <p>My next challenge arises! <br> I am now proudly focusing all of 
        my time designing the first draft of my book cover. <br> This is much harder than I anticipated, but 
        the theme I am going for is vintage science fiction style. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-image sample-2"></div> 
        <h2>Late June 2022</h2>
        <p>I'm at a point now of checking the final revisions that the editor has made for me. <br>
            Once I have checked that I'm happy with her revisions, that is it for the editing process. <br>
            All that is left after this is formatting and we're there.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-image sample-1"></div> 
        <h2>Early June 2022</h2>
        <p>I have officially sent my manuscript off to an editor. <br>

            I'm very excited and nervous, this is a huge milestone. <br>
            
            I have also chosen my cover artist, found online with an impressive website. We have agreed on a price for his services. All we need to do now is to place
             an order, and start to think which style would suit my project.</p>
