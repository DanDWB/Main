        <h2>Mid Aug 2022</h2>
        <p>I have officially set the estimated launch date, after a 3 year long journey, with what started as just a creative hobby, has turned into so much more <br>
        I'm aiming much higher than this now, thinking about how I can eventually
    see my books in local stores!</p>
    </div>

        <h2>Late July 2022</h2>
        <p>Having agreed a style and sending basic sketches to the cover artist, we have come up with the finished article. I have also purchased and paid for my
             two x ISBN numbers, one for the ebook and one for the paperback. 
            The official cover is in my possession. All that time spent 
            brainstorming, that kept me up some nights, was finally worth it! <br>
            It looks better than I anticipated.

        <h2>Late July 2022</h2>
        <p>I have made adjustments in align with the final revisions. <br>
        I'm proud to say, My next stage will be finally getting round to editing the book cover!!</p>

        <h2>July 2022</h2>
        <p>My next challenge arises! <br> I am now proudly focusing all of 
        my time designing the first draft of my book cover. <br> This is much harder than I anticipated, but 
        the theme I am going for is vintage science fiction style. </p>

        <div class="card-image sample-2"></div> 
        <h2>Late June 2022</h2>
        <p>I'm at a point now of checking the final revisions that the editor has made for me. <br>
            Once I have checked that I'm happy with her revisions, that is it for the editing process. <br>
            All that is left after this is formatting and we're there.</p>

        <h2>Early June 2022</h2>
        <p>I have officially sent my manuscript off to an editor. <br>

            I'm very excited and nervous, this is a huge milestone. <br>
            
            I have also chosen my cover artist, found online with an impressive website. We have agreed on a price for his services. All we need to do now is to place
             an order, and start to think which style would suit my project.</p>
